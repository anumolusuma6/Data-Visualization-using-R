# Lower Mainland Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
The Lower Mainland Air Quality Analysis Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to visualize and analyze daily average air pollution concentrations and temperature data collected from various monitoring stations in the Lower Mainland. This project provides insights into air quality trends and their potential impact on public health.

### Data Source
The dataset comprises real observations of air quality parameters and temperature collected between October 15-21, 2022. The data were sourced from the BC Air Data Archive website (BC Air Data Archive), which provides current and historical data on ambient air quality and meteorological conditions across British Columbia.

### Main Variables
Ozone (O3): Daily average concentration in parts per billion (ppb).
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): Daily average concentration in parts per billion (ppb).
Temperature: Daily average temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C).
Health Authority (HA): The regional health authority each monitoring station is located in.
Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA): The specific service delivery area within the health authority.
### Visuals
Time Series Plots: Displaying trends in O3, NO2, and temperature over the analysis period.
Regional Heatmaps: Visualizing pollutant concentrations across different HAs and HSDAs.
Correlation Plots: Showing the relationship between temperature and pollutant levels.
Box Plots: Comparing pollutant concentrations across different regions.

#### BC Air Data Archive: Source of the air quality and meteorological data.
