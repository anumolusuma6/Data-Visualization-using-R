# Lower Mainland Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
The Lower Mainland Air Quality Analysis Dashboard is a robust analytical tool developed using R, designed to analyze and visualize air quality data collected from multiple monitoring stations. This project focuses on key variables such as ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and temperature, with data segmented by Health Authority (HA) and Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA). The aim is to provide insights into air pollution levels and their variation across different regions in the Lower Mainland over a specified period.

### Data Source
The dataset comprises real observations of air quality parameters and temperature collected between October 15-21, 2022. The data were sourced from the BC Air Data Archive website (BC Air Data Archive), which provides current and historical data on ambient air quality and meteorological conditions across British Columbia.

### Main Variables
Ozone (O3): Daily average concentration in parts per billion (ppb).
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): Daily average concentration in parts per billion (ppb).
Temperature: Daily average temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C).
Health Authority (HA): The regional health authority each monitoring station is located in.
Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA): The specific service delivery area within the health authority.
### Visuals
Time Series Plots: Displaying trends in O3, NO2, and temperature over the analysis period.
Regional Heatmaps: Visualizing pollutant concentrations across different HAs and HSDAs.
Correlation Plots: Showing the relationship between temperature and pollutant levels.
Box Plots: Comparing pollutant concentrations across different regions.

#### BC Air Data Archive: Source of the air quality and meteorological data.
